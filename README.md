# CoolAPIs
This repository contains some APIs my friends and I consider cool.

## Java
Mapstruct - mapping from and to DTO beans made easy: http://mapstruct.org/

Project Lombok - Auto-generating lots and lots of methods to avoid boilerplate code: https://projectlombok.org

Flyway - Database migration tool for JVM-based Applications. Nearly as great as rake: http://flywaydb.org/

Javaslang - Javaslang core is a functional library for Java 8+. It helps to reduce the amount of code and to increase the robustness. A first step towards functional programming is to start thinking in immutable values. Javaslang provides immutable collections and the necessary functions and control structures to operate on these values. The results are beautiful and just work.

FunctionalJava - Use functional programming in your Java program. For all the Haskell lovers that also code in Java: http://www.functionaljava.org/

##Haskell

Snap Framework - Haskell Web Framework with a great templating engine and good performance
